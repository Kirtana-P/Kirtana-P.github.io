    <h2>Projects</h2>
    Image Cartoonify-Machine learning,Deep learning,Python
    This project converts any human face into a cartoon character. Image cartoonify is created using GAN(generative adversarial network) and CNN
(convolutional neural network) which are the most popular libraries used in Deep Learning.
    We fine-tuned this with a pre-trained model called which is trained on many people's faces.
